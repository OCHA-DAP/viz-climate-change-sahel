            <h1>A Race to Adapt:<br>The Climate Crisis in the Sahel</h1>
            <p>A Chadian girl’s daily journey to fetch water reveals the climate-triggered shocks experienced by her community</p>
          </div>
        </section> 
        <section class='section' data-section='2'>
          <div class='box'><p>The Sahel is a region at the frontlines of the global climate crisis. Temperatures have increased significantly in recent decades and are projected to rise another 3-6 degrees by the end of the 21st century. Unprecedented extreme climates are projected to occur as early as the 2030s.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>Extreme poverty, conflict, overexploitation of natural resources, limited knowledge of climate risks in development actions, low development, and high economic dependence on agriculture and pastoralism make the Sahel particularly vulnerable to climate change. The impacts of climate change exacerbate poverty and can lead to increased conflict, displacement, and food shortages, compounding an already desperate situation. In 2021, almost 29 million Sahelians are in need of humanitarian assistance and protection, 5 million more than in the previous year.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>Follow the story of 12-year-old Zara* who travels 10km each day to fetch water for her family in western Chad as they struggle to adapt to a rapidly changing climate.</p></div>
        </section> 
        <section class='section' data-section='3'>
          <div class='box'><p>Zara and her family were forced to relocate after a severe drought, triggered by rising temperatures and low rainfall, struck their village in Chad’s Lac province. The resulting poor harvest meant that Zara’s family would not have enough food to last them the rest of the year. They moved to a nearby village to stay with Zara’s uncle, whose small home is located 5km from the nearest source of water.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>In Chad, the task of collecting water tends to be done by girls and women. On average, women in rural Africa walk 6km a day to fetch water, though for some the distance is much longer. Zara usually fetches water before going to school, which she misses on days when her journey takes longer than expected.</p></div>
        </section>
        <section class='section' data-section='4'>
          <div class='box'><p>As she starts her journey for water, Zara passes by a dried up river bed. In Chad, frequent droughts in recent years have caused rivers to dry up, resulting in dwindling supplies of water. In addition to slow-onset disasters like droughts, floods have also become more common in Chad since the 1990s, due to the increase in annual rainfall and the inability of dry, sandy lands to absorb it.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>Since 2008, nearly 7 million people in Chad have been affected by droughts and floods. These shocks displace communities, destroy livelihoods and undermine economic development. In 2020 alone, 20 out of 23 provinces in Chad were impacted by floods.</p></div>
        </section>
        <section class='section' data-section='5'>
          <div class='box'><p>Another kilometer down the road, Zara passes a herd of cattle. Changing weather patterns and decreased resource availability have disrupted traditional migration routes for pastoralists. Over the course of only a decade, landlocked Chad’s northern and central desert zones have spread 150 km south, shrinking fertile grazing and farming land.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>At the same time, the rainy season has become shorter, forcing pastoralists to be on the move for longer periods, moving south earlier and converging in areas where modern water points are available.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>Since 2008, 800,000 people have been displaced in Chad due to climate related disasters.  Many more are using migration as an adaptation strategy.</p></div>
        </section>
        <section class='section' data-section='6'>
          <div class='box'><p>As Zara continues her journey, she passes by a patch of farmland that has been trampled by cattle of pastoralists forced to migrate south before crops could be harvested.  The diminished availability of both land and water resources has made insufficient harvests and food shortages more common and threatens the livelihood of farmers across the country. The competition for limited resources between farmers and pastoralists has also led to an increase in intercommunal conflict, compounding an already fragile situation.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>In Chad, over four million people are affected by food insecurity and malnutrition each year. In 2021, this number is expected to reach 5,1 million people during the lean season, with 1,7 million people experiencing severe food insecurity.  During the lean season, the period between sowing and harvesting, many people in the region are left with little or no access to food for months on end. This situation is likely to worsen with the relentless ravages of climate change.</p></div>
        </section>
        <section class='section' data-section='7'>
          <div class='box'><p>After hours walking through perilous terrain, Zara reaches her destination. She fills her container with water from a well, which could be contaminated by dust or cattle manure. Zara is tired from the long journey but does not have time to rest, so she quickly starts the journey back home.</p></div>
          <div class='box'><p>Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. Every day we witness its impact on the world’s most vulnerable people, such as girls like Zara, her family, and the communities of farmers and pastoralists she passes along her journey. By 2050, 200 million people globally may need humanitarian assistance annually due to climate-related disasters alone.</p></div>

        <p>The six Sahelien countries being explored (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria) are among the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, though their contributions to climate change are among the lowest (with Nigeria being higher than the others). In addition to experiencing the most extreme effects of climate change, these countries are also the least prepared to deal with its grave and worsening consequences.</p>
